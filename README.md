# UWP_Music_2
The UWP Music player app developed has a home page which shares the videos to the user by default where he can play and listen to them.
The Songs are displayed based on their Category and the song can be searched for in the right side toolbar option.
The User Playlist can be created on click of Add Song where an entry in the file system is made. A text file maintains the attributes of the song and later read for the 
User Playlist display.

We are working on providing login feature for the music app and we shall integrate it shortly into the git
